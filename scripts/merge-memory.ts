/**
 * merge-memory, union two copies of the translation memory.
 *
 *   node --import tsx scripts/merge-memory.ts --branch <dir> --run <dir> --out <dir>
 *
 * ── WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL ──
 * `sync-docs.yml` regenerates `src/generated/` on every run and commits it. When two runs overlap,
 * a release dispatch and the run before it, both trees are complete and they differ wherever the
 * upstream repositories moved. Git cannot know that one of them is simply newer, so a rebase
 * conflicts and a text merge of two generations produces a tree that matches neither: docs synced
 * at one tag beside a `SOURCE.json` from another. That happened on 2026-09-07 in run 34096862439.
 *
 * The workflow resolves that by regenerating rather than reconciling: it throws the merge away and
 * keeps the newest complete generation, which is this run's own. That rule is right for every
 * generated file except one.
 *
 * ── THE MEMORY IS BOUGHT, NOT DERIVED ──
 * `src/generated/docs-i18n/<locale>.json` is not a function of the three source repositories. It is
 * a record of sentences a model was PAID to translate, keyed by a hash of the English. Taking this
 * run's copy whole would delete the entries the other run bought minutes earlier, and the next run
 * would buy them again and charge for them again. So the memory is unioned instead: every key from
 * both sides survives.
 *
 * ── ON A KEY PRESENT IN BOTH SIDES, THIS RUN'S VALUE IS KEPT ──
 * A key is a hash of the English, so both sides translated the SAME sentence. Both answers are
 * correct German by construction and neither is better; the translator is not deterministic, which
 * is the whole reason two runs can hold different values for one key. There is no adjudication to
 * do, so the rule is the one that needs no judgement: this run wins, the same as every other
 * generated file. Preferring the branch instead would be equally correct and harder to explain
 * beside the rest of the resolution.
 *
 * ── A DIRECTORY, NOT A FILE ──
 * The locales come from `app/i18n/language.ts` and a third one must not need an edit here. Taking
 * directories also covers the case where one side has a locale file the other has never written,
 * which is exactly what the run that ADDS a language looks like from the branch's point of view.
