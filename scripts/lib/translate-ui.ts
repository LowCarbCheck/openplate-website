/**
 * The decisions `translate-ui` makes, cut out of the CLI so a test can call them.
 *
 * Same cut, and for the same reason, as `scripts/lib/translate.ts`: a file whose
 * body runs on import cannot be imported by a test without spending money and
 * calling `process.exit`. The CLI keeps the arguments, the gates and the
 * reporting; everything with a decision in it lives here.
 *
 * ── WHAT IS NEVER SENT TO THE MODEL, AND WHY ──
 * A catalog leaf is not a sentence. Some of them are a product name, a version,
 * a diagram edge that is one placeholder. Sending those buys nothing and can
 * lose something: "openplate" has come back from a translator as "Offener
 * Teller" before, and a value that is only `{{price}}` has nothing in it to
 * translate at all. `skipReason` answers with the reason, and `null` when the
 * leaf is prose:
 *
 *   'placeholder-only'  Strip every `{{placeholder}}` and every `<tag>`, and
 *                       nothing is left. There are no words to buy.
 *   'number'            What is left has no letter in it, in any script:
 *                       "2026", "16:8", "1.6 g/kg". A number is the same number
 *                       in every language this site ships.
 *   'proper-noun'       Every word of it is a term `KEEP` already tells the
 *                       model to leave in English: "openplate", "openplate-core",
 *                       "GitHub". One ordinary word anywhere in the value and it
 *                       is prose again, which is why "openplate app server" is
 *                       sent and "openplate-core" is not.
 *
 * A skipped leaf keeps whatever the target bundle already holds, and that is
 * almost always the English, which is what a reader should see for these.
 *
 * ── INTERPOLATION SAFETY ──
 * `{{price}}` is a value i18next substitutes and `<selfHosting>` is an element
 * `<Trans>` maps to a component. A translation that renames, drops or invents
 * one of those does not fail loudly: the placeholder renders as literal braces,
 * or the link disappears and takes its words with it, and the page still reads
 * as a page. `carriesTokens` compares the two SETS, because moving a link to the
 * other end of a German sentence is exactly what the tag is for, and losing it
 * is not.
