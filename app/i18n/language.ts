/**
 * language.ts, the site's language model. The URL is the whole of it.
 *
 * This site is prerendered to static HTML at build time, so the language cannot
 * come from a cookie, a header or a stored preference: those are read at
 * request time, and there is no request. Every page therefore exists twice, at
 * its German path and again under the `/en` prefix, and the prefix in the URL
 * IS the language. A crawler, a shared link and a browser back button all agree
 * on which document they are looking at, and both copies are cacheable forever.
 *
 * ── THE DEFAULT LANGUAGE AND THE SOURCE LANGUAGE ARE NOT THE SAME THING ──
 * They were the same value while both were `en`, and reading one where the
 * other was meant cost nothing. German now owns the root, so the two have come
 * apart and every reader of this module has to say which one it wants:
 *
 *   DEFAULT_LANGUAGE  German. It owns the unprefixed URLs, so `openplate.de/docs`
 *                     IS the German document, and it is the language of any path
 *                     that carries no prefix. This is a question about the URL.
 *   SOURCE_LANGUAGE   English. It is the hand-written bundle, it is the language
 *                     the upstream repositories write their documentation in,
 *                     and it is the key the translation memory is stored under.
 *                     So it stays the fallback for a missing key and the text a
 *                     translation is made from. This is a question about the
 *                     words, not about where they are served.
 *
 * The rule of thumb: ask for DEFAULT_LANGUAGE when you are routing, ask for
 * SOURCE_LANGUAGE when you are translating. A check that reads "is this the
 * default language" and means "is this page untranslated" is now backwards, and
 * it fails silently, because both branches still render.
 *
 * Client- and server-safe: plain string work, no `document`, no server imports.
